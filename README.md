# AgricultureProductionOptimisation
# 🌾 Agriculture Production Optimization

A machine learning project to predict crop yield using key environmental and agricultural features such as rainfall, temperature, soil pH, and fertilizer usage.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses supervised machine learning techniques to forecast crop yield based on historical data. It helps in strategic planning for agriculture and food production by modeling how various factors impact crop yield per hectare.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🔍 **Continuous yield prediction** using Linear Regression and Random Forest
- 📈 Trained on **10,000+ records** from over 10 years of government and research datasets
- 🧪 Evaluated using:
  - **R² Score**: `0.87`
  - **RMSE**: `2.3`
- 📊 Statistical dashboards and visualizations
- 🌐 Integrated frontend with `index.html` and backend powered by `Flask`

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Flask (for web app)
- HTML5, Bootstrap 5, Chart.js
- Pickle (for saving trained models)
